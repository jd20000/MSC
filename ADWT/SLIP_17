Model the following Books and Publisher information as a graph model, 
and answer the following queries using Cypher.
Author wrote various types of books which is published by publishers.
A reader reads a books according to his linking and can
recommend/provide review for it.

1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and
   draw a high-level Graph model. 

2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
   visualize your actual Graph model.

CREATE
(a1:Author {name:'R.K. Laxman'}),
(a2:Author {name:'Amish Tripathi'}),
(a3:Author {name:'Stan Lee'}),

(b1:Book {title:'Comics World', type:'Comics'}),
(b2:Book {title:'Shiva Trilogy', type:'Mythology'}),
(b3:Book {title:'Science Daily', type:'Science'}),

(p1:Publisher {name:'Sage'}),
(p2:Publisher {name:'Nirali'}),
(p3:Publisher {name:'Penguin'}),

(r1:Reader {name:'Rahul'}),
(r2:Reader {name:'Sita'}),
(r3:Reader {name:'Mitesh'}),

(a3)-[:WROTE]->(b1),

(b1)-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(p1),

(r1)-[:REVIEWED {rating:5}]->(b1),
(r2)-[:REVIEWED {rating:4}]->(b2),
(r3)-[:REVIEWED {rating:2}]->(b1);

3. Answer the Queries

a. List the names of authors who wrote “Comics”.
MATCH (a:Author)-[:WROTE]->(b:Book {type:'Comics'})
RETURN a.name;

b. Count no. of readers of book published by “Sage”.
MATCH (:Reader)-[:READ]->(:Book {title:'Comics World'})-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(:Publisher {name:'Sage'})
RETURN count(*) AS TotalReaders;

c. List all the publisher whose name starts with “N”
MATCH (p:Publisher)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'N'
RETURN p.name;

d. List the names of people who have given a rating of (>=3) for book
MATCH (r:Reader)-[rev:REVIEWED]->(b:Book {title:'Comics World'})
WHERE rev.rating >= 3
RETURN r.name, rev.rating;
